## Overview

This directory contains exercises focused on pointers, arrays, and strings in C. Below is a summary of what was done in each task.

# Tasks

Task 0: 98 Battery st.
What Was Done: Created a function that takes an int pointer as a parameter and sets the value it points to 98.

Task 1: Don't swap horses in crossing a stream
What Was Done: Implemented a function to swap the values of two integers using their pointers.

Task 2: This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read
What Was Done: Wrote a function that returns the length of a string.

Task 3: I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them
What Was Done: Created a function to print a string followed by a new line.

Task 4: I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear
What Was Done: Implemented a function to print a string in reverse order, followed by a new line.

Task 5: A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes
What Was Done: Wrote a function to reverse a string in place.

Task 6: Half the lies they tell about me aren't true
What Was Done: Created a function to print every other character of a string, starting with the first character.

Task 7: Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half
What Was Done: Implemented a function to print the second half of a string. If the string length is odd, the function prints the last n characters.

Task 8: Arrays are not pointers
What Was Done: Wrote a function to print the first n elements of an integer array, separated by commas and spaces.

Task 9: strcpy
What Was Done: Created a function to copy a string from a source to a destination buffer.

Task 10: Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers
What Was Done: Implemented a function to convert a string to an integer, handling signs and ignoring non-numeric characters.

Task 11: Don't hate the hacker, hate the code
What Was Done: Created a program to generate random valid passwords for a specific challenge. The program uses standard library functions to create a password that meets the challenge's requirements.
