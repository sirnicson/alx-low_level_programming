## 0x07. C - Even More Pointers, Arrays and Strings

Description
This project focuses on advanced usage of pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. It includes a series of tasks that explore memory manipulation, string operations, and matrix computations.

# Tasks

0. memset
Prototype: char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);
Description: Fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b.
File: 0-memset.c

1. memcpy
Prototype: char *_memcpy(char *dest, char *src, unsigned int n);
Description: Copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest.
File: 1-memcpy.c

2. strchr
Prototype: char *_strchr(char *s, char c);
Description: Locates the first occurrence of the character c in the string s.
File: 2-strchr.c

3. strspn
Prototype: unsigned int _strspn(char *s, char *accept);
Description: Gets the length of a prefix substring consisting only of bytes from accept.
File: 3-strspn.c

4. strpbrk
Prototype: char *_strpbrk(char *s, char *accept);
Description: Searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
File: 4-strpbrk.c

5. strstr
Prototype: char *_strstr(char *haystack, char *needle);
Description: Locates a substring within a string.
File: 5-strstr.c

6. Chess is mental torture
Prototype: void print_chessboard(char (*a)[8]);
Description: Prints the chessboard.
File: 7-print_chessboard.c

7. The line of life is a ragged diagonal between duty and desire
Prototype: void print_diagsums(int *a, int size);
Description: Prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix.
File: 8-print_diagsums.c

8. Double pointer, double fun
Prototype: void set_string(char **s, char *to);
Description: Sets the value of a pointer to a char.
File: 100-set_string.c
