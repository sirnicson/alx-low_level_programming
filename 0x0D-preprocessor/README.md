# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor

This repository contains exercises that explore various aspects of the C preprocessor. The exercises focus on using macros for different tasks in C programming.

## Tasks

0. Object-like Macro
Create a header file that defines a macro named SIZE. This macro should represent the value 1024. The goal is to understand how to define and use object-like macros.

1. Pi
Create a header file that defines a macro named PI. This macro should represent the value 3.14159265359. This exercise helps in understanding the definition of constants using macros.

2. File Name
Write a C program that prints the name of the file from which it was compiled. This exercise demonstrates the use of the __FILE__ macro to retrieve and print the file name at compile time.

3. Function-like Macro
Define a function-like macro named ABS(x) that calculates the absolute value of a number x. This exercise teaches how to create and use function-like macros for simple calculations.

4. SUM
Define a function-like macro named SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of two numbers, x and y. This exercise illustrates how to create and use function-like macros to perform operations on multiple arguments.
