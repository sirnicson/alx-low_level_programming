## Objective
This project focuses on mastering advanced concepts of pointers, arrays, and strings in C. The tasks cover a range of functions and techniques to manipulate and process strings and arrays, as well as to handle specific coding challenges.

# Tasks

0. strcat
Objective: Concatenate two strings.
Description: Implemented a function to append the src string to the dest string and return a pointer to the resulting string.

1. strncat
Objective: Concatenate a specified number of bytes from one string to another.
Description: Created a function to concatenate up to n bytes from src to dest, ensuring that src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes.

2. strncpy
Objective: Copy a string up to a specified length.
Description: Developed a function to copy up to n bytes from src to dest, handling cases where src is shorter than n by padding dest with null bytes.

3. strcmp
Objective: Compare two strings.
Description: Implemented a function to compare two strings character by character and return an integer indicating the difference between them.

4. reverse_array
Objective: Reverse the content of an integer array.
Description: Created a function to reverse the elements of an integer array by swapping elements from the start and end, moving towards the center.

5. string_toupper
Objective: Convert all lowercase letters in a string to uppercase.
Description: Developed a function to convert each lowercase letter in a string to uppercase.

6. cap_string
Objective: Capitalize the first letter of each word in a string.
Description: Implemented a function to capitalize the first letter of each word, considering separators like spaces and punctuation.

7. leet
Objective: Encode a string into 1337 (Leet) speak.
Description: Created a function to replace certain letters in a string with corresponding numbers using only one if statement and two loops.

8. rot13
Objective: Encode a string using the ROT13 cipher.
Description: Developed a function to shift letters 13 positions in the alphabet, employing only one if statement and two loops.

9. print_number
Objective: Print an integer without using arrays or pointers.
Description: Implemented a function to print an integer by breaking it down into its digits and outputting each one using the _putchar function.

10. magic
Objective: Modify code to print a specific value.
Description: Added a single line of code to print the value of a[2] as 98, adhering to constraints of not modifying existing variables or using additional commas.

11. infinite_add
Objective: Add two numbers represented as strings.
Description: Created a function to add two positive numbers (given as strings) and store the result in a buffer, ensuring the result fits within the provided buffer size.

12. print_buffer
Objective: Print the contents of a buffer in a formatted manner.
Description: Developed a function to print the content of a buffer in hexadecimal format, showing 10 bytes per line with printable characters and their hexadecimal values.
