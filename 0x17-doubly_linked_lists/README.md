# 0x17. C - Doubly Linked Lists

This project involves implementing a doubly linked list data structure in C. It includes various functions to manipulate the list, such as adding, deleting, and printing nodes.

## Requirements
- All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All files should end with a new line.
- Follow Betty style for code formatting.
- No global variables are allowed.
- Maximum of 5 functions per file.
- Allowed standard library functions: `malloc`, `free`, `printf`, `exit`.

## Tasks
- Print list: Function to print all elements of a dlistint_t list.
- List length: Function to return the number of elements in a dlistint_t list.
- Add node: Function to add a new node at the beginning of a dlistint_t list.
- Add node at the end: Function to add a new node at the end of a dlistint_t list.
- Free list: Function to free a dlistint_t list.
- Get node at index: Function to return the nth node of a dlistint_t list.
- Sum list: Function to return the sum of all data (n) in a dlistint_t list.
- Insert at index: Function to insert a new node at a given position.
- Delete at index: Function to delete the node at a specific index.
